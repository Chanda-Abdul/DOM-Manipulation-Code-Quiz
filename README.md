## Your Task
 
You’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment;
perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes
both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 
 
Let’s build a timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions. 
This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically
updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. 
It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
